  .intro
    p In prepration for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, a Minnesota Women’s Auxiliary Board was put together to create a design. They hosted a contest and from 200 submissions, local artist Amelia Hyde Center designed the winning flag.
    p It was embroidered by Pauline and Thomane Fjelde, sisters who won a gold medal for their work. The flag was officially adopted April 4, 1893.
    p In 1957, the flag was simplified for easier production and changed again in 1983, to reflect updates to the state seal.
    p This version of the flag was officially adopted August 2, 1983.

      h2 Coat of Arms
      p The original seal and coat of arms depicted a Sioux man in war attire fleeing into the distance.
      p This was seen as offensive and historically inaccurate, so the seal was updated in 1983 to depict the man riding his horse #[em toward] the pioneer. This was meant to include Native Americans in Minnesota history.
      p Still, many would prefer the flag be redesigned entirely, introducing bills and petitions to change the flag. None have been successful, yet.
